<p>
The Lospec Pixel editor is a free pixel art program that you can use right here
in your web browser. Our goal was to create an easy to use, intuitive and
unobtrusive pixel art application that you can use anywhere. Whether you're
creating assets for a game or just want to make 8 bit art, this tool is an easy
way to pixel fast.

<p>
This application does not have all the features of more advanced desktop editor,
but we will add more over time. It currently features a pencil, eraser, fill, pan, eyedropper
and zoom tool. You can also easily adjust any colors in your palette. You can
use any palette in our <a href="/palette-list">Palette List</a> by clicking the pencil next to the palette
title.

<p>
This app currently only works on desktops, and requires a modern browser such as
the latest versions of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox or Chrome</a>.
